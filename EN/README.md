**Welcome to My Quantitative Finance Projects**

This is the English-language section of my portfolio, containing a series of educational Jupyter Notebooks on quantitative finance and data science. Each notebook is designed to be a self-contained learning module, perfect for students and professors.

**How to Use These Notebooks**

You have two options for interacting with these notebooks:

**1. View Statically:** Simply click on any notebook file below to view the content directly on GitHub.

**2. Run Interactively**: For a fully interactive experience, click on the Google Colab badge. This will open the notebook in your browser, allowing you to run the code and modify it without any installation.
